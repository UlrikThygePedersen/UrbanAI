# System Architecture

## Overview

The Smart City Traffic Management System is built using a multi-agent framework that optimizes urban traffic flow, public transportation, and pedestrian safety through collaborative agents.

### Key Components:

1. **Traffic Light Control Agent**: Manages the city's traffic signals.
2. **Public Transport Agent**: Optimizes bus and train schedules.
3. **Emergency Response Agent**: Ensures emergency vehicles can move through the city efficiently.
4. **Pedestrian Flow Agent**: Manages pedestrian crossings to balance foot and vehicle traffic.
5. **Coordination Agent**: Ensures smooth collaboration between all other agents.

### Communication Flow:

- **User Input**: The system is initialized by the user providing a task to the Coordination Agent.
- **Agent Collaboration**: The Coordination Agent delegates tasks to the respective agents, depending on the type of task (e.g., traffic management, emergency routing).
- **Real-Time Decisions**: Agents make real-time decisions using input data from APIs and pass results back to the Coordination Agent for overall decision-making.
