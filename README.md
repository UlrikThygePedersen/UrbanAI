## Overview

UrbanAI is a cutting-edge **multi-agent system** designed to manage and optimize urban traffic, public transportation, emergency response, and pedestrian flow. By leveraging **AI-driven agents** within the **OpenAI Swarm framework**, this project showcases the potential of autonomous, real-time decision-making systems to tackle urban challenges.

The system includes specialized agents‚Äîeach responsible for specific operations in the city‚Äîworking together to improve traffic flow, streamline public transport, prioritize emergency vehicles, and ensure pedestrian safety. These agents coordinate to optimize city infrastructure, reduce congestion, and improve overall urban efficiency.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how **AI** can be applied to improve urban environments, while showcasing expertise in building scalable, intelligent systems using Python, multi-agent frameworks, and API-driven architectures.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Real-Time Traffic Management**
   - **Scenario**: The Traffic Light Control Agent uses vehicle density data to dynamically adjust signal timings and reduce congestion.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces vehicle wait times, enhances traffic flow, and decreases emissions.

### 2. **Public Transportation Optimization**
   - **Scenario**: The Public Transport Agent reroutes buses based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring efficient schedules.
   - **Benefit**: Increases reliability of public transport and minimizes passenger delays.

### 3. **Emergency Vehicle Prioritization**
   - **Scenario**: The Emergency Response Agent clears traffic for emergency vehicles by adjusting signals and rerouting traffic.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces response times for emergency services, potentially saving lives.

### 4. **Pedestrian Flow Management**
   - **Scenario**: The Pedestrian Flow Agent adjusts crosswalk timings based on pedestrian density, balancing foot traffic with vehicle flow.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures pedestrian safety while maintaining vehicle traffic efficiency.

### 5. **City-Wide Coordination**
   - **Scenario**: The Coordination Agent oversees the actions of all agents, ensuring seamless operations across the city.
   - **Benefit**: Holistic city management with smooth integration of traffic, public transport, emergency services, and pedestrian safety.

## Project Architecture

This project uses a **Swarm-based multi-agent framework** where each agent has specific tasks and works collaboratively to achieve city-wide efficiency.

### Key Agents:
1. **Traffic Light Control Agent**: Optimizes traffic signal timings based on vehicle count at intersections.
2. **Public Transport Agent**: Manages bus and train routes, adjusting for real-time traffic conditions and passenger loads.
3. **Emergency Response Agent**: Clears routes for emergency vehicles, ensuring they can navigate through traffic efficiently.
4. **Pedestrian Flow Agent**: Manages pedestrian crossings, adjusting signal timings based on foot traffic at intersections.
5. **Coordination Agent**: Monitors city-wide conditions and coordinates the other agents to ensure smooth operations.

---

## Code Example

The following is an example of how the Coordination Agent interacts with the Traffic Light Control Agent to adjust traffic light timings based on vehicle density at an intersection.

```python
from UrbanAI.agents import coordination_agent
from swarm import Swarm

client = Swarm()

response = client.run(
    agent=coordination_agent,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Check traffic at intersection 12"}],
    context_variables={
        "intersection_id": 12,  # Intersection to check
    },
    max_turns=3,
)

print(response.messages[-1]["content"])
```

## Next Development Steps

To further improve and expand **UrbanAI**, consider the following next steps:

### 1. **Integrate Real-Time Data**
   - **Description**: Connect the system to real-world APIs such as **Google Maps Traffic API**, **OpenWeather API**, or local transport and emergency systems to provide real-time data on traffic, weather, and public transportation.
   - **Benefit**: Allows the agents to make real-time decisions based on live conditions, significantly enhancing the system's accuracy and utility.
   - **Action**: Replace the simulated API calls in the agent functions (e.g., `get_vehicle_count`, `get_traffic_conditions`) with real API requests.

### 2. **Implement Predictive Analytics**
   - **Description**: Train machine learning models to predict traffic congestion, public transport delays, or emergency incidents based on historical data.
   - **Benefit**: Predictive models allow agents to proactively manage city infrastructure, such as adjusting traffic lights or rerouting buses before congestion or delays occur.
   - **Action**: Integrate libraries like **scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow** to implement time-series forecasting models that agents can use for decision-making.

### 3. **Develop a Visualization Dashboard**
   - **Description**: Build an interactive dashboard to visualize real-time agent activity, traffic conditions, public transport data, and emergency responses.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a user-friendly way for city administrators or system users to monitor the status of the entire system in real time.
   - **Action**: Use frontend frameworks such as **Streamlit** or **Dash** to build a dynamic interface that displays key metrics like traffic flow, agent decisions, and alerts.

### 4. **Expand to Larger City Simulations**
   - **Description**: Simulate a larger city or multiple zones, with more agents managing various aspects of the city's infrastructure, such as parking management, pollution control, or energy grid optimization.
   - **Benefit**: Increases the scalability and applicability of the system to more complex urban environments.
   - **Action**: Create additional agents (e.g., **Parking Management Agent**, **Energy Grid Agent**) and integrate them into the coordination system, allowing for a more comprehensive smart city solution.

### 5. **Multi-Objective Optimization**
   - **Description**: Instead of optimizing agents for a single objective (e.g., minimizing traffic wait time), incorporate multi-objective optimization to balance multiple factors, such as reducing fuel consumption, minimizing pollution, or maximizing pedestrian safety.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a more holistic approach to managing urban infrastructure, allowing for more nuanced decision-making.
   - **Action**: Update the **Genetic Algorithm** or introduce other optimization techniques to handle multiple objectives simultaneously, ensuring that agents consider a variety of factors when making decisions.
